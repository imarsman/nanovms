# nanovms
Test of nanovms with Golang

This code is based on some that I wrote for an evaluation.

The goal of this small project is to explore the use of the ops and nanovms
unikernel to deploy as an instance image on a cloud platform. I am using GCP in
this instance. Although it may run as compiled it is not ready to deploy.
