<h1>Sample GRPC passthrough showing random xkcd cartoons</h1>

<p>
    Note: There may be a networking issue with the GRPC calls. I will work on
    it. Sadly this is likely because GCP handles http2 connections differently.
    I have to find  out if I can bypass this. In the meantime I have skipped the
    GRPC call and just use an HTTP one. Note that the GRPC server does work
    locally but not when the firewall in place (in this case GCP) is not letting
    HTTP2 connections through.
</p>
<p>
    This is an overly complicated page in that it uses a GRPC server started by
    the application which is queried by the handler. The GRPC call itself calls
    a simple HTTP client which gives the data back. The GRCP client gets the
    data then the handler sends it as a JSON payload to the page.
</p>

<p>
    Although it is a bit tedious to set up a GRPC server it was not too
    difficult to figure out. There are many advanced features such as streaming
    and TLS and authorization that I have not explored.
