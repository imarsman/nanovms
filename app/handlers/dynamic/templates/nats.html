<h2>Nats demo</h2>

<p>
    This is a simple NATS messaging service demonstration. A search is be
    requested from within the page and internally a request is to a handler that
    calls a built in NATS server which calls an HTTP client that calls an API
    function. The client's returned JSON is parsed and then that is used to
    populate a structure which is used by a template to produce an HTML snippet.
</p>
<p>
    The search done is of the PLOS article library. There is supposed to be an
    API requiring a key but as far as I can tell the API can be queried with no
    key.
</p>
<p>
    I am new to NATS but it looks great. If you look at the code I have written
    to implement it and you are an old hand at using NATS I'm sure you will find
    lots of problems. I hope I will find those problems as I keep working on
    this. There are many aspects of NATS that I have not explored, such as
    publish/subscribe, queuing, authentication, clustering, etc.
