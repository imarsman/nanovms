        <p>A demonstration of using nanovms in the cloud</p>
    </header>

    <p>
        Nanovms is a unikernel which can run a single process. Wikipedia <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">defines</a> a unikernel
        as 
        <blockquote>
            A unikernel is a specialised, single address space machine image
            constructed by using library operating systems. A developer selects,
            from a modular stack, the minimal set of libraries which correspond
            to the OS constructs required for the application to run. These
            libraries are then compiled with the application and configuration
            code to build sealed, fixed-purpose images (unikernels) which run
            directly on a hypervisor or hardware without an intervening OS such
            as Linux or Windows.
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://www.nanovms.com">Nanos</a> has build an open source
        unikernel and provided a <a href="https://nanovms.gitbook.io/ops/">tool</a>
        called ops to allor for the building of a unikernel and deployment on a
        growing list of cloud platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to experiment with the feasibility of
        deploying and updating unikernels in the Google Cloud Platform in a
        similar way to Docker with Kubernetes or with AWS Fargate. It is hoped
        that instances can be clustered and scaled using the services provided
        by providers such as Google and AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the ops tool has been found to be capable of using a Linux
        targetted build of a simple app and putting it in the Google cloud to
        run in a small instance. There are some issues related to doing things
        like allowing HTTP ports to be used for instances which are likely due
        to my own lack of experience rather than underlying issues with the
        available tools.
